This is a template library for \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_filter}{\texttt{ particle filtering}}. Templated abstract base classes for different particle filters are provided (e.\+g. the Bootstrap Filter, the S\+I\+SR filter, the Auxiliary Particle Filter, the Rao-\/\+Blackwellized particle filter), as well as non-\/abstract (but indeed templated) base classes for closed-\/form filtering algorithms (e.\+g. Kalman Filter, Hidden Markov Model filter, etc.).

Once you have a certain model in mind, all you have to do is make it into a class that inherits from the filter you want to use.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md28}{}\doxysection{Dependencies}\label{index_autotoc_md28}
This code makes use of the following libraries\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/}{\texttt{ Eigen v3.\+3}}
\item \href{https://www.boost.org/}{\texttt{ Boost v1.\+65.\+1}}
\item \href{https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2}{\texttt{ Catch2}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Also, your compiler must enable C++17.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md29}{}\doxysection{Installation}\label{index_autotoc_md29}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md30}{}\doxysubsection{Option 1\+: Install with $<$tt$>$\+C\+Make$<$/tt$>$}\label{index_autotoc_md30}
{\ttfamily git clone} this Github repostory, {\ttfamily cd} into the directory where everything is saved, then run the following commands\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}mkdir build && cd build/
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local
sudo cmake --build . --config Release --target install --parallel
\end{DoxyVerb}


You may subsitute another directory for {\ttfamily /usr/local}, if you wish. This will also build unit tests that can be run with the following command (assuming you\textquotesingle{}re still in {\ttfamily build/})\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}./test/pf_test
\end{DoxyVerb}


Note\+: for this to method work, you will need to install Catch2 \char`\"{}system wide\char`\"{} so that its {\ttfamily $\ast$.cmake} files are installed as well. To do this, \href{https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/docs/cmake-integration.md\#installing-catch2-from-git-repository}{\texttt{ click here}}.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md31}{}\doxysubsection{Option 2\+: Drag-\/and-\/drop $<$tt$>$.\+h$<$/tt$>$ files}\label{index_autotoc_md31}
This is a header-\/only library, so there will be no extra building necessary. If you just want to copy the desired header files from {\ttfamily include/pf} into your own project, and build that project by itself, that\textquotesingle{}s totally fine. There is no linking necessary, either. If you go this route, though, make sure to compile with C++17 enabled. Note, also, that this code all makes use of \href{http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/}{\texttt{ Eigen v3.\+3}} and \href{https://www.boost.org/}{\texttt{ Boost v1.\+65.\+1}}. Unit tests use the \href{https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2}{\texttt{ Catch2}} library.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md32}{}\doxysection{Examples}\label{index_autotoc_md32}
Don\textquotesingle{}t know how to use this? No problem. Check out the \href{https://github.com/tbrown122387/pf/tree/master/examples}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily examples}}} sub-\/directory. This is a stand-\/alone cmake project, so you can just copy this sub-\/directory anywhere you like, and start editing.

For example, copy to {\ttfamily Desktop} and have at it\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}cp -r ~/pf/examples/ ~/Desktop/
cd Desktop/examples/
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
\end{DoxyVerb}


If there are no error messages, you will have an executable named {\ttfamily pf\+\_\+example} in that same directory. Running it without command line arguments will prompt you for arguments and tell you how it can be used.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md33}{}\doxysection{Contributing}\label{index_autotoc_md33}
